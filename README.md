# SEC Labo 1 - Input Validation Library

## Goal 
The objective of this lab is to create an input validation library allowing to validate the
following inputs:
• URL validation
• File validation
• UUID validation (UUID version 5)
You are of course expected to write unit tests to confirm the proper behaviour of the
validation functions. Don't forget your edge cases ! You will then write an example program
using this library.
